<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This project is a responsive feature section that showcases a simple layout of three cards with different content and icons. It was designed and built as part of a challenge from [DevChallenges.io](http://devchallenges.io). The layout uses Flexbox for arranging the cards, and custom styles are applied to make the design both mobile-friendly and visually appealing.

### What I learned

During this project, I gained more experience working with:
- **Flexbox** for creating a responsive, flexible layout for the cards.
- **Negative margins** to fine-tune spacing between elements, especially for pulling content closer.
- **Responsive design** techniques using media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
- **Using custom fonts** and icons to enhance the design and visual appeal.

### Useful resources

Flexbox Froggy - A fun game that helped me solidify my knowledge of Flexbox.
CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide - An essential guide for learning Flexbox properties and behavior.
DevChallenges.io - A great platform for practicing frontend and backend development skills through real challenges.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Google Fonts
- Emoji for Design - To enhance the UI with simple emoji icons

## Features

Responsive layout: The cards adjust for different screen sizes using Flexbox and media queries.
Centered content: The cards are horizontally centered on the screen, and wrap onto the next line when necessary.
Icon-based cards: Each card has a relevant emoji inside a circular background to make the design more visually engaging.
